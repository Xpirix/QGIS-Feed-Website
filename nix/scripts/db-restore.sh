# Restore the local development database from a pg_dump custom-format archive.
#
# The Nix equivalent of `make dev-dbrestore`, with two deliberate differences:
#
#   * Only the qgisfeed database is restored. The Makefile also restores
#     metabase, which is not part of the Nix stack - it is served by the
#     surrounding infrastructure.
#   * The dump is restored with --no-owner --no-privileges. Production dumps are
#     owned by the "docker" role, which does not exist in the project-local
#     cluster, and without these flags every statement would fail.
#
# DESTRUCTIVE. This drops the local development database. It only ever touches
# the project-local cluster under .nix/pgdata; it cannot reach a docker volume,
# a staging box or production. It asks first unless --force is given.
#
# usage: db-restore.sh [--force] [path/to/dump.dmp]
