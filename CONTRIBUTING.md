## 🧑💻 Development

For development purposes only, you can run this application in debug mode with docker compose. Some of the docker compose commands are already configured in the Makefile.

## 🏃Before you start

This project requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the development and production environments.
Please ensure both are installed on your system before proceeding.

![Docker logo](https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png)

You can check your installation with:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](./img/green-gradient.png)

## 🛒 Getting the Code

- Clone git repo `git clone https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Feed-Website.git`
- Run `$ pwd` in order to get your current directory
- Path to your repo should be `<your current directory>/QGIS-Feed-Website `
- Go to dockerize directory `cd QGIS-Feed-Website`

![-----------------------------------------------------](./img/green-gradient.png)

## Pre-commit hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate code quality checks before each commit. To set it up:

1. Install pre-commit (if not already installed):
    ```sh
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, the configured checks (such as linting and formatting) will run automatically when you commit changes.

### ❄️ Nix

The flake provides a complete development environment: Python, Node, and a
project-local PostgreSQL/PostGIS cluster. **Docker is not required** if you
develop this way.

```sh
nix develop                     # enter the environment (direnv users: just `cd` in)
./scripts/nix/db-start.sh       # start the local PostgreSQL/PostGIS
./scripts/nix/db-reset.sh       # create the schema and load the fixtures
./scripts/nix/fetch-geoip.sh    # download the GeoLite2 City database (once)
./scripts/nix/dev.sh            # webpack watch + Django dev server on :8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The fixtures create the same users as the
docker path.

#### Commands

Run the helpers directly when you are inside `nix develop`; every tool they need
is already on `PATH`. The `nix run` column is for invoking them from an ordinary
shell without entering the environment first.

| Inside `nix develop` | From outside | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `./scripts/nix/db-start.sh` | `nix run .#db-start` | Start the local PostgreSQL/PostGIS cluster |
| `./scripts/nix/db-stop.sh` | `nix run .#db-stop` | Stop it |
| `./scripts/nix/db-reset.sh` | `nix run .#db-reset` | Drop and recreate the DB, migrate, load fixtures (prompts first) |
| `./scripts/nix/db-restore.sh` | `nix run .#db-restore` | Restore the DB from a `pg_dump` archive (prompts first) |
| `./scripts/nix/manage.sh <cmd>` | `nix run .#manage -- <cmd>` | Run any Django management command |
| `./scripts/nix/dev.sh` | `nix run .#dev` | Run webpack in watch mode plus the Django dev server |
| `./scripts/nix/test.sh` | `nix run .#test` | Run the Django test suite |
| `./scripts/nix/fetch-geoip.sh` | `nix run .#fetch-geoip` | Download `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` |
| `./scripts/nix/format.sh` | `nix fmt` | Format every `.nix` file in the tree |
| — | `nix flake check` | Evaluate every output and run the checks |

Both columns work from anywhere; the script form simply skips a flake
re-evaluation on every call.

#### How it is put together

- **State** lives in `.nix/` (git-ignored): the PostgreSQL cluster in
  `.nix/pgdata`, its socket in `.nix/run`, the GeoIP database in `.nix/geoip`.
  Delete the directory to start over.
- **The database** is an unprivileged cluster owned by you, listening on a unix
  socket inside the repository only. Nothing is bound to a network interface,
  so it cannot clash with a system PostgreSQL.
- **Settings** come from `qgisfeedproject/settings_nix.py`. It inherits
  `settings.py`, whose `DATABASES` block is already environment driven;
  `scripts/nix/common.sh` points `QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBHOST` at the local socket.
  (`settings_dev.py` is not reused because it hardcodes `HOST = "postgis"`,
  which only exists inside the docker compose network.)
- **Python dependencies** come from nixpkgs, except three that nixpkgs cannot
  supply at the version this project needs; those are built from real
  derivations in `nix/python-packages.nix`. There is no pip step and no
  virtualenv.
- **nixpkgs** is pinned centrally for all QGIS repositories via
  [qgis-nixpkgs-version](https://github.com/QGIS/qgis-nixpkgs-version). Bump it
  there, not here.
- **Shell helpers** are ordinary scripts in `scripts/nix/`, wrapped by the
  flake. Nothing but wiring lives in the `.nix` files.

#### Configuration (`.env`)

`scripts/nix/common.sh` reads the same git-ignored `.env` that docker compose
uses, so site configuration is defined once. `env.template` is the committed
reference. To add a variable, put it in `env.template` and in your `.env`; the
Nix helpers pick it up with no further wiring.

Precedence is **explicit shell environment > `.env` > built-in defaults**, so a
one-off override works:

```sh
QGISFEED_BACKUP_VOLUME=/mnt/other ./scripts/nix/db-restore.sh
```

The file is parsed rather than sourced, so nothing in it is executed.

Docker-only keys are ignored by the Nix path — importing them would point it at
the docker database role and at the docker settings override, which hardcodes
`MEDIA_ROOT=/shared-volume/media` and fails outside a container. The ignore list
is `_qgisfeed_env_is_docker_only` in `scripts/nix/common.sh`.

Note that `.env` also carries SMTP and social-media credentials. Loading it
exports those into your development shell, exactly as it does for docker
compose. Production does not use this path at all: the NixOS module passes
secrets via `EnvironmentFile` so they never enter the Nix store.

#### GeoIP data

The geofence feature needs `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, which is MaxMind licensed and
therefore not committed or vendored. `./scripts/nix/fetch-geoip.sh` downloads it into
`.nix/geoip/`. Without it, location lookups silently return no result.

#### Deployment

This flake exports **no NixOS module**. The QGIS infrastructure already has a
generic `qgis.djangoApp` module that owns PostgreSQL, nginx, Metabase, ACME and
the state directories; a second module here would be a competing implementation.
The flake's job is to produce the application closure.

`nix build` gives:

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qgisfeed-manage` | `manage.py` wrapper - `migrate`, `collectstatic`, … |
| `qgisfeed-uwsgi` | uWSGI with the python3 plugin, speaking the uwsgi protocol to nginx |

There is deliberately no gunicorn entry point: nginx uses `uwsgiPass`, and the
docker image runs gunicorn from its own entrypoint rather than from this
closure. For a local production-like run over plain HTTP, give uWSGI a socket:
`qgisfeed-uwsgi --ini "$(nix build .#qgisfeed.uwsgiIni --no-link --print-out-paths)" --http-socket 127.0.0.1:8000`.

Both bake in `GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`, `GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PROJ_LIB` and
`PYTHONPATH`, so GeoDjango finds its libraries in the Nix store. Never set
those from the outside.

Configuration is split the way the infrastructure already splits it:

- **Environment** for values the deployment knows: `DEBUG`,
  `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, `STATIC_ROOT`,
  `QGISFEED_DOCKER_DB*`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_RATE`. `settings.py` reads all
  of these directly, so `qgisfeedproject.settings` is a usable production
  settings module.
- **`settings_local_override.py`** for everything else, including secrets,
  selected by `DJANGO_LOCAL_SETTINGS` and applied last so it wins. See the note
  above: `.env` is not supported by the production infrastructure.

Moving a host off the container means replacing three units - the image load,
the `-manage` one-shot and the `oci-containers` service - with
`qgisfeed-manage migrate`, `qgisfeed-manage collectstatic` and `qgisfeed-uwsgi`
run from the store. PostgreSQL, nginx and Metabase are already native and need
no change; because `qgisfeed-uwsgi` speaks the uwsgi protocol, the existing
`uwsgiPass` nginx block keeps working as is.

#### What the package exposes

Application facts are attached to the derivation, so a host configuration does
not hardcode them and several hosts cannot drift apart:

| `passthru` attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| `manageProgram` | `qgisfeed-manage` |
| `uwsgiProgram` | `qgisfeed-uwsgi` |
| `wsgiModule` | `qgisfeedproject.wsgi` |
| `settingsModule` | `qgisfeedproject.settings` |
| `uwsgiIni` | base worker tuning, `nix/uwsgi.ini` |
| `fetchGeoip` | package that downloads `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` |

`uwsgiIni` carries `workers`, `cheaper` and `harakiri` but deliberately no
socket, pidfile or chdir: worker counts follow the application's memory profile
and belong to this repository, while the socket is a host decision. Append a
second `--ini`, or pass `--socket`, to add it.

`fetchGeoip` takes the destination directory as its argument and needs no
checkout, so a host can run it from a systemd timer:

```
${qgisfeed.fetchGeoip}/bin/fetch-geoip /var/lib/qgisfeed/geoip
```

#### Environment contract

Every variable `qgisfeedproject/settings.py` reads. Anything not listed here is
not configurable through the environment.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | `True` | Set `False` in production; error pages otherwise expose settings and environment |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | – | Comma separated; drives `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`. `QGIS_FEED_PROD_URL` is the older name and still works |
| `MEDIA_ROOT` | `<checkout>/qgisfeedproject/media` | Uploaded files |
| `STATIC_ROOT` | `<checkout>/qgisfeedproject/static_collected` | `collectstatic` destination |
| `GEOIP_PATH` | `/var/opt/maxmind/` | Directory holding `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` |
| `DB_NAME` | `qgisfeed` | |
| `DB_USER` | `qgisfeed` | |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | empty | Not needed with peer or trust authentication |
| `DB_HOST` | `/var/run/postgresql` | A path is a unix socket directory |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | |
| `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | see `settings.py` | |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | empty | Secret |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | empty | Secret |
| `SENTRY_RATE` | `1.0` | |
| `MASTODON_API_BASE_URL`, `BLUESKY_HANDLE`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | – | Non-secret halves of the syndication settings |
| `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | empty | Secrets |
| `DJANGO_LOCAL_SETTINGS` | `settings_local_override.py` | Path to the settings file below; absolute paths are accepted |

The `DB_*` names replace `QGISFEED_DOCKER_DB*`, which are still accepted as a
fallback. Nothing about the deployment is docker specific any more.

`SECRET_KEY` and `QGISFEED_MAX_RECORDS` are deliberately absent: the first is a
secret and the second has no environment variable, so both come from the
settings file.

This table is enforced, not just documented - see `settings-contract` below.
Change a variable name and that check fails, rather than a deployment breaking
silently.

#### Formatting

Nix files are formatted with [nixfmt](https://github.com/NixOS/nixfmt). It is
not configurable, so there is nothing to agree on - run it and commit the
result:

```bash
nix fmt                    # the whole tree
nix fmt nix/package.nix    # one file
```

`nix fmt` goes through `scripts/nix/format.sh` rather than calling `nixfmt`
directly. `nixfmt` only accepts files, and `nix fmt` hands its formatter the
tree root as a bare `.`; given that, `nixfmt` finds no files, falls back to
reading stdin and hangs with no output. The wrapper expands directories first.

Formatting is enforced in three places, and only the first is optional:

1. The `nixfmt` pre-commit hook. It is a `language: system` hook, so it runs
   the `nixfmt` from the devShell. **Committing from outside `nix develop` -
   from an IDE, for instance - silently skips it**, because the command is not
   on `PATH`.
2. The `nixfmt` flake check, so a checkout that never installed the hooks
   cannot drift.
3. The `nix-checks` GitHub workflow, which runs that check on every pull
   request.

#### Tests

`nix flake check` runs everything. The logic lives in `tests/nix/`, never in the
`.nix` files.

| Check | What it proves | Needs a database |
|---|---|---|
| `shellcheck` | Every script in `scripts/nix` and `tests/nix` is clean | no |
| `nixfmt` | The `.nix` files are formatted, even without the pre-commit hooks | no |
| `passthru-contract` | Every program, ini and module name in `passthru` exists and imports | no |
| `settings-contract` | The environment table above, including the `QGISFEED_DOCKER_*` fallback and the override precedence rule | no |
| `migration-drift` | The models match the committed migrations | no |
| `uwsgi-app-load` | The WSGI callable imports inside uWSGI's own embedded interpreter | no |
| `integration` | `migrate`, `collectstatic`, the Django suite, and one real HTTP request served by uWSGI | yes |

The first six finish in seconds. `integration` starts its own PostGIS cluster in
the build sandbox on a unix socket in `$TMPDIR`, so it cannot touch a developer's
PostgreSQL, and takes minutes. Run one on its own with:

```bash
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.settings-contract -L
```

Reach for that when a run fails: `nix flake check` stops at the first failing
check, so a formatting slip can mask whether the application still imports and
serves. The `nix-checks` workflow runs each check as its own job for the same
reason.

Two things worth knowing if you edit these:

- `passthru-contract` reads the program names off `passthru` rather than
  hardcoding them, so renaming one surfaces as a failure instead of a check
  that quietly tests nothing.
- `integration` installs PostGIS into `template1`. No migration runs
  `CreateExtension`, so without that the test database Django creates has no
  `geometry` type and the run dies before the first test.

For a normal development run against the project-local cluster, use
`./scripts/nix/test.sh` (or `nix run .#test`) instead - it is much faster than
rebuilding the closure.

### ⚡️ Quick Start
- Build the docker the container
```bash
$ make dev-build
```

#### Environment setup
- Create `settings_local.py` int the `qgisfeedproject` directory, configure the media folder as in the example below:

```python
# Settings local for docker compose production settings
import os

MEDIA_ROOT = '/shared-volume/media/'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
STATIC_ROOT = '/shared-volume/static/'
STATIC_URL = '/static/'


if not os.path.exists(MEDIA_ROOT):
    os.mkdir(MEDIA_ROOT)

if not os.path.exists(STATIC_ROOT):
    os.mkdir(STATIC_ROOT)
```

- Generate the `.env` from `env.template` and edit it with your email variables:
```sh
cp env.template .env
nano .env
```
Don't forget to specify the QGISFEED_MEDIA_VOLUME with your media directory

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/email/#module-django.core.mail for further email configuration.

- To prevent DDOS attacks there is limit in the number of returned records (defaults to 20): it can be configured by overriding the settings in `settings_local.py` with:

```python
QGISFEED_MAX_RECORDS=40  # default value is 20
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: For new Django variables, please use the `settings_local_override.py` as the `.env` file is not supported by the new production infrastructure.

#### Django Local Settings Override (`settings_local_override.py`)

- Create settings_local_override.py file
```bash
$ cp settings_local_override.py.templ settings_local_override.py
```

- Edit settings_local_override.py file and set your environment variables

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: As we are migrating to a declarative based infrastructure, it is preferable to use the `settings_local_override.py` file for all new Django variables. This file is ignored when commiting so please make sure you define your new variables with an example value (**NOT THE REAL ONE FOR SECRETS AND PASSWORDS**) inside the `settings_local_override.py.templ` file.

#### Spin up the development environment

- Start the docker the container
```bash
$ make dev-start
```

- Run migrations:
```bash
$ make dev-migrate
```

- Create an admin user and set a password:
```bash
$ make dev-createsuperuser
```

- Show the development server logs:
```bash
$ make dev-logs
```


A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:8000

To enter the control panel http://localhost:8000/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

    </br>
For production, you can run this application with make commands or docker compose:

Docker configuration should be present in `.env` file in the main directory,
an example is provided in `env.template`:

```bash
# This file can be used as a template for .env
# The values in this file are also the default values.

# Host machine persistent storage directory, this path
# must be an existent directory with r/w permissions for
# the users from the Docker containers.
QGISFEED_DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME=/shared-volume

# Number of Gunicorn workers (usually: number of cores * 2 + 1)
QGISFEED_GUNICORN_WORKERS=4

# Database name
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBNAME=qgisfeed
# Database user
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBUSER=docker
# Database password
QGISFEED_DOCKER_DBPASSWORD=docker
```

```bash
$ make start
```

A set of test data will be automatically loaded and the application will be available at http://localhost:80

To enter the control panel http://localhost:80/admin, two test users are available:

- Super Admin: the credentials are `admin`/`admin`
- Staff (News Entry Author): the credentials are `staff`/`staff`

### Enable SSL Certificate on production using Docker

1. Generate key using openssl in dhparam directory
```bash
openssl dhparam -out /home/web/qgis-feed/dhparam/dhparam-2048.pem 2048
```

2. Run the container
```bash
$ make start
```

3. Update `config/nginx/qgisfeed.conf` to include the new config file in `config/nginx/ssl/qgisfeed.conf`
```
include conf.d/ssl/*.conf;
```

4. Restart nginx service
```
nginx -s reload
```

5. To enable a cronjob to automatically renew ssl cert, add `scripts/renew_ssl.sh` to crontab file.

Sometimes it seems our cron does not refresh the certificate. We can fix like this:

**Gentle Way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
scripts/renew_ssl.sh
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

**More crude way**

```
ssh feed.qgis.org
cd /home/web/qgis-feed
make start c=certbot
make restart c=nginx
```

Now check if your browser is showing the site opening with no SSL errors: https://feed.qgis.org

## Backups

If something goes terribly wrong, we keep 7 nights of backups on hetzner and daily backups on a storage box.

If those are also not useful there are a collection of snapshot backups on hetzner and on a storage box

Last resort: Tim and Lova makes backups to his local machine on a semi-regular basis.
