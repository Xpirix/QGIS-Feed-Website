    anonymous user that is right. For a user who is already signed in it is a
    loop: they authenticate, get bounced back here, and see a login form while
    the header offers them a logout.

    That combination was rare before, because every staff account was in the
    authors group. It is ordinary now: roles are mirrored from Keycloak at
    every sign-in, so an account with no feed role legitimately ends up signed
    in with no permissions. Say that, rather than showing the form again.

    ``QgisFeedUserVisitMiddleware`` substitutes a shared ``qgis_user`` account
    on anonymous requests, so ``request.user.is_authenticated`` is true even
