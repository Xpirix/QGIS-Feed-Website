# .env is the same file docker compose reads (env.template documents it). It is

# social tokens, Sentry DSN. Loading it here means a variable added for docker
# is automatically available to the Nix stack too.
#
# It is parsed, not sourced: sourcing would execute whatever is in the file, and
# docker compose does not give .env shell semantics either. Precedence is
#   explicit shell environment  >  .env  >  the defaults set below
# so `QGISFEED_BACKUP_VOLUME=/tmp ./scripts/nix/db-restore.sh` still works.

# Keys describing the docker stack are ignored: taking them would point the
# Nix path at the docker database role and at the docker settings override
# (which hardcodes MEDIA_ROOT=/shared-volume/media and fails outside a
# container). Add to this list, not to the parser, if a new docker-only key
# appears in env.template.
